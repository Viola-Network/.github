## About Us

Viola Network develops projects and supports open-source contributions. We create our own projects and sponsor external initiatives.

Our activities include:

1. **Viola Projects**: We create and maintain a suite of projects under the Viola name, each designed to serve specific developer and public needs.

2. **Project Sponsorship**: We actively seek out and sponsor promising projects from external developers and teams. If you have a great idea, we're here to support it.

3. **Open Source Contributions**: We're committed to giving back to the developer community by contributing to and supporting open-source projects.
